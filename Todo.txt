Create functionality to compose a meal
    --> User searches for a food | done
    --> Gets all the possible matches | done
    --> Clicks on the desired result | done
    --> Adds that food to a list that appears on the left of the screen | done
    --> Each item of the list has a quantity field associated with it | done
    --> Each item of the list can be removed from it | done
    Issue#1 --> Details of the meal appear on the right of the screen as user adds more foods
        to it (amount of calories, protein, fat etc)
        --> Need to find a way to allow user to change the quantity of each food individually,
            and details of the meal on the right of the screen should be updated accordingly | done
            
    Issue#2 --> Button at the bottom of the list that allows user to save the meal (which will 
        be found on the 'My meals' page)
        -> If no food entered for the meal, error message should appear to let user 
            know that they have to enter at least one food | done
        -> ELse, Modal should be displayed to ask for confirmation | done
        -> If user cancels, modal should close and user will still be on /new-meal page | done
        -> If user confirms, meal should be saved to database, and user redirected to /my-meals | done

        Create tables in database to store meals created by user | done
            --> 3 tables :
                -meal_user -> per tuple : meal id, foreign key that references user who created that meal (users)
                -meal_foods -> per tuple : name of food, its quantity, foreign key 
                               that references corresponding meal (meal_user)
                -meal_values -> per tuple : calories, protein, carbs, sugar, fat, 
                                saturated fat, fiber, foreign key that references corresponding meal (meal_user)

    Issue#3 --> when MyMeals loads, user's meals should be displayed on the page (if there are any)

! Think about environment variables for database credentials ! | done

Work on FoodSearchPublic and UserDashboard components -> redundancy that could possibly be avoided | done
